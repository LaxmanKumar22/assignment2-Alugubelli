###### My favourite place in the world is Switzerland.
Switzerland is a beautiful, **tourist-attracting country**. It is most famous for its ski resorts during the winter, it is beautiful all year round. Skiing in Switzerland is in my bucket list. Its a great treat to watch **Alpine mountains stretch across the Balkans to France**, making Switzerland the perfect skiing destination.
