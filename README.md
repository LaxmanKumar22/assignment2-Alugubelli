###### My favourite place in the world is Switzerland.
Switzerland is a beautiful, **tourist-attracting country**. It is most famous for its ski resorts during the winter, it is beautiful all year round. Skiing in Switzerland is in my bucket list. Its a great treat to watch **Alpine mountains stretch across the Balkans to France**, making Switzerland the perfect skiing destination.

## Directions to my favourite place
1. Take a safe ride from Maryville to Kansas city.
2. Board a plane in Kansas airport to New York.
3. Travel from New York to Bern (Switzerland) through air.
4. After reaching the Bern airport we have multiple transport ways to reach the destination place.
    1. Roadways (Rental vehicles, hired vehicles, buses)
    2. Airways
    3. Railways
5. Better to prefer roadways for roadside scenes. It takes 3 hrs to reach the desired destination.
6. Things I bring for maximum enjoyment.
    * Playing cards
    * Alcohol
    * Meat
